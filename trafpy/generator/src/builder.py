    """Create demand data dictionary using given distributions.

    If num_ops_dist and c are left as None, return flow-centric demand data.
    Otherwise, return job-centric demand data.

    Args:
        eps (list): List of network endpoints.
        node_dist (numpy array): 2d matrix of source-destination probabilities
            of occurring
        flow_size_dist (dict): Probability distribution whose key-value pairs are 
            flow size value-probability pairs. 
        interarrival_time_dist (dict): Probability distribution whose key-value pairs are 
            interarrival time value-probability pairs. 
        network_load_config (dict): Dict of form {'network_rate_capacity': <int/float>, 'target_load_fraction': <float>, 'disable_timeouts': <bool>, 'return_new_interarrival_time_dist': <bool>},
            where network_rate_capacity is the maximum rate (in e.g. Gbps) at which
            information can be reliably transmitted over the communication network
            which the demand data will be inserted into, and where target_load_fraction
            is the fraction of the network rate capacity being requested by the demands
            (e.g. target_load_fraction=0.75 would generate demands which request
            a load that is 75% of the network rate capacity from the first to 
            the last demand arriving). disable_timeouts defines whether or not 
            to stop looping when trying to meet specified network load. return_new_interarrival_time_dist
            defines whether or not to return the new interarrival time dist which
            was adjusted to meet the network node requested.
            If network_load_config is None, must specify num_demands
        num_ops_dist (dict): Probability distribution whose key-value pairs are 
            number of operations (in a job) value-probability pairs. 
        c (int/float): Coefficient which determines job graph connectivity and
            therefore the number of edges in the job graph. Use this because, for
            large enough c and n (number of nodes), edge formation probability
            when using Erdos-Renyi random graph creation scales with the
            number of edges such that p=c*ln(n)/n, where graph diameter (and
            number of edges) scales with O(ln(n)). See
            https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/598/chap4only.pdf for more information.
        use_multiprocessing (bool): Whether or not to use multiprocessing when
            generating data. For generating large numbers of big job computation
            graphs, it is recommended to use multiprocessing.
        min_num_demands (int): Minimum number of demands to generate (will increase
            beyond this if need to meet min_last_demand_arrival_time and/or to
            meet specified jensen_shannon_distance_threshold).
        jensen_shannon_distance_threshold (float): Maximum jensen shannon distance
            required of generated random variables w.r.t. discretised dist they're generated from.
            Must be between 0 and 1. Distance of 0 -> distributions are exactly the same.
            Distance of 1 -> distributions are not at all similar.

            N.B. To meet threshold, this function will keep doubling num_demands
        min_last_demand_arrival_time (int, float): Minimum last time of arrival
            for final demand (helps user specify a minimum simulation time). Will
            keep doubling number of demands until get >= min_last_demand_arrival_time.
        auto_node_dist_correction (bool): If True, if a node dist and overall load
            is specified which is not valid since would lead to at least one endpoint
            link's load exceeding 1.0, TrafPy will automatically adjust the node 
            dist by distributing the excess load uniformally across all other valid
            end points. As such, as the network load tends to 1.0, the node dist
            will approach uniform with 1.0 load being requested on all end point links.
        print_data (bool): whether or not to print extra information about the
            generated data (such as time to generate).
        path_to_save (str): Path to directory (with file name included) in which
            to save generated distribution. E.g. path_to_save='data/dists/my_dist'.

    Returns:
        dict: Generated demand data (either flow-centric or job-centric demand
            demand data depending on the args given to the function).

        N.B. If network_load_config is not None, will return tuple of
        (demand_data, interarrival_time_dist) to give updated interarrival time dist
        needed to meet network_load_config requested.

Therefore the more time slots there are, the more processing overhead there is, and therefore the longer the simulation will take. If many of your slot sizes are redundant (i.e. no new flow information is arriving), it is advisable to increase the slot size -> decrease the number of slots -> decrease the number steps in the simulation -> decrease the simulation time. Conversely, if you have a high number of demands arriving per time slot, your scheduler will have a lower resolution to process the flows which can lead to poorer performance and more flows being perhaps unnecesserily dropped from your network. As a rule of thumb, having an average number of flows arriving per time slot of less than 1 is not needed.')
