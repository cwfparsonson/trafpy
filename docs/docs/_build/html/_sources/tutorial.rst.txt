Tutorial
========
This guide can help you start with TrafPy. For more detailed examples, see the
`examples <https://github.com/cwfparsonson/trafpy/tree/master/examples>`_ directory of the TrafPy 
`GitHub <https://github.com/cwfparsonson/trafpy>`_. It is recommended that you both 
read this guide and then look at the basic GitHub examples to learn how to use
TrafPy.

.. note::
    TrafPy users who are not familiar with Python can read the whole :doc:`TrafPy Generator <tutorial_generator>`
    section to understand how some of the TrafPy functions work. However, they may find 
    it more useful to skip to the :doc:`Visually Shaping TrafPy Distributions <tutorial_visually_shaping_distributions>` section, 
    which describes how to use the TrafPy Jupyter Notebook as a stand-alone tool
    (universally compatible file formats (CSV, JSON, Pickle, etc.) can be generated 
    and imported into e.g. MATLAB scripts; no Python knowledge is required),
    and also to look at the simple GitHub examples.
