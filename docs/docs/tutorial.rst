Tutorial
========
This guide can help you start with TrafPy.

.. note::
    TrafPy users who are not familiar with Python can read the TrafPy Generator
    section to understand how some of the TrafPy functions work. However, they may find 
    it more useful to skip to the Visually Shaping TrafPy Distributions section, 
    which describes how to use the TrafPy Jupyter Notebook as a stand-alone tool
    (CSVs can be generated and imported into e.g. MATLAB scripts; no Python knowledge
    is required).
